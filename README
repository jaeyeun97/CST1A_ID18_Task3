This weather app is made by Group 18 of the Interaction Design course, Computer Science Tripos 2016-17, at the University of Cambridge.
It is intended for Parachute Engineers, specifically the father of a member of the team.

The app consists of two parts: the map, and the text.
The map shows the forecast of the next 36 hours, in desired map selected by the checkboxes on the left side of the screen.
The forecast can be reached by the slider on the bottom of the map, which brings in the new map data in 3 hour steps.
Precipitation, Pressure, Cloud, and Temperature maps are available, and are given by the public API of the Met Office.
There also is a zoom slider which adjusts the zoom level of the map.
